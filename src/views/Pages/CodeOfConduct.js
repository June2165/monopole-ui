          Financial integrity and fiscal responsibility are core aspects of
          corporate professionalism. This is more than accurate reporting of our
          financials, though that’s certainly important. The money we spend on
          behalf of MNPL is not ours; it’s the company’s and, ultimately, our
          shareholders’. Each person at MNPL– not just those in Finance – has a
          role in making sure that money is appropriately spent, our financial
          records are complete and accurate, and internal controls are honored.
          This matters every time we hire a new vendor, expense something to
          MNPL, sign a new business contract, or enter into any deals on MNPL’s
          behalf.

              behalf, make sure that the cost is reasonable, directly related to
              company business, and supported by appropriate documentation.
              Always record the business purpose (e.g., if you take someone out
              to dinner on MNPL, always record in our expense reimbursement tool
              the full names and titles of the people who attended as well as
              the reason for the dinner) and comply with other submission
              requirements. If you’re uncertain about whether you should spend
              money or submit an expense for reimbursement, check with your
              referent. Referents are responsible for all money spent and
              expenses incurred by their direct reports and should carefully
              review such spend and expenses before approving.

              It goes without saying (but we’re going to say it anyway) that you
              should never, ever interfere in any way with the auditing of
              MNPL’s financial records. Similarly, you should never falsify any
              record or account, including time reports, expense accounts, and
              any other Monopole records.

            <Text lineHeight="24px" fontSize="16px" fontWeight="400" mb="10px">
              As MNPL grows, we enter into more and more deals with suppliers of
              equipment and services. We should always strive for the best
              possible deal for MNPL. This almost always requires that you
              solicit competing bids to make sure that you’re getting the best
              offer. While price is very important, it isn’t the only factor
              worth considering. Quality, service, reliability, and the terms
              and conditions of the proposed deal may also affect the final
              decision. Please do not hesitate to contact the Purchasing Team if
              you have any questions regarding how to procure equipment or
              services.

              Retaining Records
            </Text>
            <Text lineHeight="24px" fontSize="16px" fontWeight="400" mb="50px">
              It’s important that we keep records for an appropriate length of
              time. The MNPL Records Retention Policy suggests minimum record
              retention periods for certain types of records. These are great
              guidelines, but keep in mind that legal requirements, accounting
              rules, and other external sources sometimes specify longer
              retention periods for certain types of records, and those controls
              where applicable. In addition, if asked by Legal to retain records
              relevant to a litigation, audit, or investigation, do so until
              Legal tells you retention is no longer necessary. If you have any
              questions regarding the correct length of time to retain a record,
              contact the Records Retention Team.

          very seriously and each of us is expected to comply with applicable
          legal requirements and prohibitions. While it’s impossible for anyone

          major laws and regulations that apply to your work. Take advantage of

              As we said earlier, internally we share information, including

              which might involve confidential information. To use this
              non-public information to buy or sell stock, or to pass it along
              to others so that they may do so, could constitute insider
              trading. Insider trading not only violates this Code, it violates
              the law. Don’t do it.

        <Text lineHeight="24px" fontSize="16px" fontWeight="600" mb="20px">
          MNPL aspires to be a different kind of company. It’s impossible to
          spell out every possible ethical scenario we might face. Instead, we
          rely on one another’s good judgment to uphold a high standard of
          integrity for ourselves and our company. We expect all Monopolers to
          be guided by both the letter and the spirit of this Code. Sometimes,
          identifying the right thing to do isn’t an easy call. If you aren’t
          sure, don’t be afraid to ask questions of your manager, Legal or
          Ethics & Compliance.
