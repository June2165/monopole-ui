        question: "What is Sustainable Finance?",
        response:
          "Finance is the set of mechanisms that provide the economy with the capital it needs to function. It plays a key role in the competitiveness and wealth of a country because its objectives are to ensure the optimal use of resources and thus to improve the well-being of all.But achieving the highest standard of living can only be achieved if the environment and natural resources are taken into account, Financing a socially just ecological transition is therefore a major challenge for the future of our societies. In order to support the real economy and long-term projects, sustainable finance favours financial operations that take into account non-financial criteria called ESG criteria: environmental, social and governance. These criteria include analysis of the impacts of companies activities in terms of carbon emissions, biodiversity protection, waste management, etc.; societal impacts; and the set of rules that govern how businesses are controlled and run.",

Everyone’s needs and opportunities are different, which is why there are many types of green finance and they are continuously evolving.","This type of financing is important because green projects are generally very capital intensive which means that most new projects would go unfinanced if there was no dedicated funding for development.",
