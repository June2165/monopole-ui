        question: "What is sustainable finance?",
        response:
          "Finance is the set of mechanisms that provide the economy with the capital it needs to function. It plays a key role in the competitiveness and wealth of a country because its objectives are to ensure the optimal use of resources and thus to improve the well-being of all.But achieving the highest standard of living can only be achieved if the environment and natural resources are taken into account, Financing a socially just ecological transition is therefore a major challenge for the future of our societies. In order to support the real economy and long-term projects, sustainable finance favours financial operations that take into account non-financial criteria called ESG criteria: environmental, social and governance. These criteria include analysis of the impacts of companies activities in terms of carbon emissions, biodiversity protection, waste management, etc.; societal impacts; and the set of rules that govern how businesses are controlled and run.",
